	<p>The brief was to develop IHPA's brand identity so that it was still recognisable, but better. It needed to be reined in, refreshed and have some solid guidelines put in place.</p>
	<p>IHPA already had a green palette that it was known for. We made them bolder and more deliberate but similar enough to be recognised as the IHPA colour palette. </p>
	<p>A hexagon graphic device was in use, which we extended into a patterned hexagon and set some solid guides around when, where and how to use each graphic. Imagery was being used, and hated by everyone, so we simplified it - no imagery. Unless using an image of a location for a specific event.</p>
	<p>Now the identity is much more direct, purposeful and consistent.</p>
